# CS31
Projects for CS31, Intro to C++, during the 2021-2022 school year.


## Project 1
Identifying logic and compile errors.

## Project 2
Created a command line app to identify water bill costs based on a given rate.

## Project 3
Command line app for a game "Sitar Hero", which will take in a string of characters representing beats and return whether or not the string has proper syntax and if so, converts it to proper formatting specified.

## Project 4
Created a library to provide common functions that manipulate arrays.

## Project 5
Command line app that will identify the amount of repeats in a "Jeet", or a provided string, such that every "Jeet" adheres to a match standard. A match standard is defined as having positive distances between the target words, every word being at least a letter long and containing no non-lowercase letters, and being unique in its target. This project writes one collection of purported match standards into standard form, and also returns the match level of a jeet (how many matches it contains). This was entre project was done with C-Strings.

## Project 6
Solved problems related to pointers.

## Project 7
Created a game where a player, indicated by "@", is in a rectangular arena filled with killer cyborgs (indicated by a digit character, a number channel the cyborg is tuned into).
Every turn, the player can move one step or stay put, and then transmit to a particular channel. Then each cyborg moves.
Normally, each cyborg moves one step in a random direction, but the player's transmitter has a 50% chance to work and make cyborgs move in the direction commanded.
If a cyborg moves to the position occupied by a player, the player dies. However, if a cyborg runs into a wall segment in the arena, they take one point of damage.
The player wins when all cyborgs have been destroyed.
